# micropak-rs
A simple file archiver, written in rust

Note that this archiver does not support archives made by its predecessor, [micropak](https://github.com/hippo-o-matic/micropak)
Both are more demo projects than production code so I don't see this being a problem currently

archiver.rs could theoretically be built as a standalone library, if you really wanted to do that.
